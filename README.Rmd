# CRANE v1.0.0

Constrained Random Alteration of Network Edges (CRANE), a computational method for sampling networks with fixed node strengths.

## Example

We have included network edge list from angiogenic ovarian cancer (ang) and non-angiogenic ovarian cancer (nonAng). The following are some example use:

```{r example}
library(CRANE)
head(ang)

# Running CRANE for bipartite network
newElist=crane.bipartite(ang,alpha=0.3)

head(newElist)

```
